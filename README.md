Homebrew-versions
=================
These formulae provide multiple versions of existing packages.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap Homebrew/versions` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one in mxcl/master, you can `brew install Homebrew/versions/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions/master/<formula>.rb
```
